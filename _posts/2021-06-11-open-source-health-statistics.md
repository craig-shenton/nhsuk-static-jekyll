The [Open-Source Health Statistics](https://nhs-pycom.github.io/opensource-health-statistics/) project was created by developers at [NHSX](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/) and [NHS Business Services Authority](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/).

We have been collecting stats on open repositories of NHS and related healthcare organisations. 

Quite interesting dataset that has lots of potential for further analysis and visualisations. 

The ‘cambrian explosion’ visualisation captures the rise in open-source software in recent years.
