# Welcome to the NHSX Coding Club

## Lesson 2: prophet

This session will discuss the use of the package “Prophet” produced by the core Data Science team at Facebook. The package is available with both python and R wrappers of the underlying stan model, which was built with accuracy, speed, interpretability, and automation in mind, for time-series forecasting at scale.

### Materials for session:
