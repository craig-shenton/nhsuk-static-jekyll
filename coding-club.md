# Welcome to the NHSX Coding Club

## Lesson 1: trashPanda!

This session will cover the use and application of python tools that allow for multiple poorly formatted excel workbooks (even within directories) to be merged and outputted into a single properly formatted CSV table. These tools have widespread practical applications for dealing with often incomplete/messy NHS data.
