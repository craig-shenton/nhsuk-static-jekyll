# Welcome to NHS.pycom: the Python community for healthcare

The NHS Python community has been created to help everyone working in health and social care develop their programming skills and apply these skills to drive the digital transformation of health care.

Python is an open source, state of the art programming language, used by developers, data scientists, and data engineers. Python’s widespread adoption is, in part, due to its accessible ‘human readable’ syntax, making it relatively easy to pick up and learn.

Along with other open source analytics tools such as R, Python will be essential to drive the 21st century digital transformation of health care.

## Principles and aims of the Python community:

- Reduce barriers to entry by promoting the use and best practice of python tools, publishing to public GitHub repositories, and using online coding platforms such as Google Colab.
- Open source and document code under appropriate licences (such as MIT, OGLv3, and GPLv3) alongside suitable open datasets or synthetic data so that our work can be further developed, re-used ,and improved upon by everyone in the community.
- Break down silos of expertise and improve technical communication and collaboration across the NHS by involving members from [AnalystX](https://future.nhs.uk/connect.ti/DataAnalyticsCovid19/grouphome), NHSE/I, [NHSX Analytics Unit](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/nhsx-analytics-unit/), the [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/), and many other organisations.
- Make coding accessible to all members of the healthcare community regardless of background or current level of ability.
